        "\n",
        "This notebook builds an interactive language learning application powered by **Google's Gemma 3n** model. The app leverages Gemma 3n's multimodal capabilities (text + image) and multilingual support (140+ languages) to create a comprehensive language learning experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Features:\n",
        "1. **📝 Writing Exercise Feedback** — Real-time grammar, vocabulary, and style correction\n",
        "2. **🖼️ Visual Object Recognition** — Upload images to identify objects and learn translations\n",
        "3. **🔄 Translation Practice** — Translate sentences and get detailed feedback\n",
        "4. **📚 Vocabulary Builder** — Generate contextual vocabulary lessons\n",
        "5. **💬 Conversation Practice** — Simulate dialogues in the target language\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Gemma 3n?\n",
        "- **Compact & Efficient**: E2B (effective 2B params) or E4B (effective 4B params) — runs on Kaggle free GPUs\n",
        "- **Multimodal**: Handles text + images natively (MobileNet-V5 vision encoder)\n",
        "- **Multilingual**: Trained on 140+ languages — perfect for African language contexts\n",
        "- **On-device ready**: Designed for edge deployment (phones, tablets)\n",

            "**1. Corrections:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **\"magazin\" changed to \"magasin\"**:  \"Magasin\" is the correct form of the word for \"shop\" or \"store\" in French.  \"Magazin\" is a misspelling.\n",
            "*   **Added a comma after \"bon\"**:  The sentence is a simple statement, and a comma is needed to separate the two independent clauses (\"Le pain était très bon\" and \"je mange beaucoup\").\n",

            "*   **Punctuation:** Commas are crucial in French for clarity.  They help to separate ideas and make your writing easier to understand.  Think of them as little pauses in the flow of your sentences.  The comma after \"bon\" creates a natural pause.\n",

Le pain était très bon, et je mange beaucoup de pain à la maison.\" (I went to the shop to buy fresh bread. The bread was very good, and I eat a lot of bread at home.)  Adding a little more description makes your writing more engaging.\n",

            "**1. Ideal Translation:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The most natural and common way to say this in Japanese would be:\n",
            "\n",
            "**今日はいい天気だから、散歩に行きたいな。**\n",
            "(Kyou wa ii tenki dakara, sanpo ni ikitai na.)\n",
            "\n",
            "*   `今日は` (Kyou wa) - Today\n",
            "*   `いい天気` (ii tenki) - Good weather\n",
            "*   `だから` (dakara) - Because / Therefore\n",
            "*   `散歩に` (sanpo ni) - For a walk (dative case)\n",
            "*   `行きたいな` (ikitai na) - I want to go (a softer, more casual expression)\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Accuracy Score:**\n",
            "\n",
            "I'd give your translation a **9/10**. It's very close and perfectly understandable!\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Specific Corrections:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Your translation, \"今日の天気はとてもいいです。散歩に行きたいです。\" is grammatically correct and conveys the meaning. However, there's a slight difference in nuance.  The difference is in the *reason* for wanting to go for a walk.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **\"今日の天気はとてもいいです。\" (Kyou wa totemo ii desu.)** - \"Today the weather is very nice.\" This is a statement of fact.\n",
            "*   **\"散歩に行きたいです。\" (Sanpo ni ikitai desu.)** - \"I want to go for a walk.\"  This is a statement of desire.\n",
            "\n",
            "The ideal translation adds a little more context, explaining *why* you want to go for a walk. The \"dakara\" (because/therefore) makes the connection between the weather and the desire to walk clearer.\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. What You Got Right:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Correct sentence structure:** You've followed the basic sentence structure of Japanese well.\n",
            "*   **Correct vocabulary:** You used the correct vocabulary for \"weather\" (天気 - tenki) and \"walk\" (散歩 - sanpo).\n",
            "*   **Polite form:**  Using \"です\" (desu) makes it polite, which is good!\n",
            "\n",
            "**5. Grammar Notes:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **\"は\" (wa):**  You used \"今日の天気は\" (kyou no tenki wa), which is correct for stating the weather.  \"は\" marks the topic of the sentence.\n",
            "*   **\"です\" (desu):**  You used \"です\" to make the sentence polite. This is appropriate for general conversation.\n",
            "*   **\"～たい\" (～tai):** This is a very common verb ending that expresses a desire or wish.  It's used with verbs like \"行く\" (iku - to go).\n",
            "*   **\"に\" (ni):** This particle indicates direction or purpose.  \"散歩に\" (sanpo ni) means \"for a walk\" or \"to go for a walk.\"\n",
            "*   **\"な\" (na):** This adds a nuance of softness or a feeling.  It makes the sentence sound a little more casual and expresses a gentle desire.\n",
            "\n",
            "**6. Alternative Translations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are a few other ways to say this, with slightly different nuances:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **今日はいい天気だから、散歩したいな。** (Kyou wa ii tenki dakara, sanpo *shitai na*.) -  This is very similar to the ideal translation, but using \"したい\" (shitai) instead of \"行きたい\" (ikitai) gives it a slightly more direct feeling of wanting to do something.\n",
            "*   **いい天気ですね。散歩に行きたいです。** (Ii tenki desu ne. Sanpo ni ikitai desu.) - \"It's nice weather, isn't it? I want to go for a walk.\"  This is a more conversational way to start.\n",
            "*   **今日はいい天気なので、散歩に行きたいです。** (Kyou wa ii tenki nano de, sanpo ni ikitai desu.) - \"Because it's nice weather today, I want to go for a walk.\" \"なので\" (nano de) is another way to express \"because.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**Overall:**\n",
            "\n",
            "You're doing great!  Don't worry about the slight difference in nuance; it's a very natural way to express your desire. Keep practicing, and you'll become more comfortable with these concepts.  Feel free to ask if you have any more questions!  Let me know if you'd like to practice more sentences or work on other grammar points.\n",

        "### How Gemma 3n Works Under the Hood:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Text Input** → Tokenized by `AutoProcessor` → Fed to language decoder\n",
        "2. **Image Input** → Resized to 256/512/768px → Encoded by MobileNet-V5 to 256 tokens → Concatenated with text tokens\n",
        "3. **Generation** → Autoregressive decoding with temperature sampling → Decoded back to text\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Technical Details:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Chat Template**: Gemma 3n uses `<start_of_turn>user\\n...\\n<end_of_turn>` format\n",
        "- **System Prompt**: Set via `{\"role\": \"system\"}` message — controls the model's behavior\n",
        "- **Image Processing**: The processor handles all resizing and normalization\n",
        "- **`disable_compile=True`**: Required for Kaggle environments to avoid JIT compilation issues\n",
        "- **`device_map=\"auto\"`**: Automatically places model layers on available GPU(s)\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🚀 Next Steps for Enhancement:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Audio Input**: Gemma 3n supports audio (USM encoder) — add speech recognition for pronunciation practice\n",
        "2. **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune on language learning datasets for better pedagogical responses\n",
        "3. **Offline Deployment**: Use LiteRT (TFLite) format for mobile/edge deployment\n",
        "4. **User Progress Tracking**: Add a database to track vocabulary mastery over time\n",
        "5. **Spaced Repetition**: Implement SRS (like Anki) for vocabulary review scheduling\n",
